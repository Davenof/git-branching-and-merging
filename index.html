      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome! In this session, we'll explore the concepts of Git branching and merging. 
        Branching allows you to create separate lines of development, while merging helps you 
        integrate changes from different branches into one. These features are essential for effective 
        collaboration and maintaining a clean project history.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Branching Section -->

      <h2>Branching</h2>
      <p>
        Branching in Git allows you to create independent lines of development. This is useful for 
        working on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. You can 
        create a new branch with the command <code>git branch &lt;branch-name&gt;</code> and switch to 
        it using <code>git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using branches helps keep your main codebase clean and stable, and allows multiple developers 
        to work on different features simultaneously. When you're ready to integrate your changes back 
        into the main codebase, you can merge your branch. Below is an example of creating a branch:
      </p>
        
      <div class="code-container">
        <pre id="code-block-1" class="code-block" data-lang="bash">
          <code class="toggle-code">
            # Create a new branch
            git branch feature-branch

            # Switch to the new branch
            git checkout feature-branch
          </code>
        </pre>
        <button class="copy-btn" aria-label="Copy to clipboard">Copy</button>
        <button class="toggle-btn" aria-label="Toggle light/dark mode" data-mode="dark">Light Mode</button>
      </div>

      <p>
        After creating a branch, you can work on your changes in isolation. This makes it easier 
        to develop features and fix bugs without interfering with the main codebase.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Merging Section -->
    <section id="merging">
      <h2>Merging</h2>
      <p>
        Merging combines changes from different branches into one. This is crucial when integrating 
        new features or bug fixes into the main codebase. The command <code>git merge &lt;branch-name&gt;</code> 
        is used to merge changes. Sometimes, you'll need to resolve conflicts manually if changes in different 
        branches are incompatible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conflicts occur when changes in two branches affect the same lines of code. Git will notify you of these 
        conflicts, and you'll need to resolve them before completing the merge. This process ensures that all 
        changes are reviewed and integrated correctly. Below is an example of merging a branch:
      </p>
      
      <div class="code-container">
        <pre id="code-block-2" class="code-block" data-lang="bash">
          <code class="toggle-code">
            # Switch to the master branch
            git checkout master

            # Merge the feature branch into the master branch
            git merge feature-branch

            # Resolve any conflicts if they occur
          </code>
        </pre>
        <button class="copy-btn" aria-label="Copy to clipboard">Copy</button>
        <button class="toggle-btn" aria-label="Toggle light/dark mode" data-mode="dark">Light Mode</button>
      </div>

      <p>
        By resolving conflicts and merging changes, you ensure that your project remains up-to-date and 
        includes the latest features and bug fixes from different contributors.
